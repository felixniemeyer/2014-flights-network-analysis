Wild ideas: 
- World coverage. what geographic surface of the world is covered by an airline

Jobs: 
- Investigate how outlier airports regarding flow_deviation appear in big airlines networks
- It would be nice to know, how many unconnected subgraphs exist

Analysis
	Numeric airline characteristics: 
		Longest path airport [steps, km]
		Connection length [km]
		  - Total 
		  - Average 
		connection length [km] * passenger flow [passenger]
		  - Total 
		  - Average
		cluster coefficient avg

	Airline distributions (all per node): 
		centrality
		degree
		passenger weighted degree
		profit weighted degree
		cluster coefficient

- Introduction: reminder, what the data looks like
	- multi directed graph 

- Data loading
	- Show SQL cleaning script to give an impression
	- Degree Distribution
		- uneven vs. even distributions

- Data enrichment
	- Patronage 
		- Wikidata
			- Show SPARQL
			- monthly vs. yearly values
			- missing patronage data from other years
			values for about 2000 airports of 8000
		- Runway surface data
			- list of runways
			- add up runway surface
			- calculate a factor: passengers per runway
			- use it to estimate patronage for remaining airports 6000
			- fun fact: need to exclude water runway surfaces - as they tend to be huge
		- Apply Threshold: avg patronage of (min 1% of airports with patronage data from wikidata) 
	- Passenger flow computation 
		- Algorithm
			- Initial flows: 
				- Calculate the total flow. 
					numbers of connections * sqrt(patronage_a / degree_a * patronage_b / degree_b).
				- Calculate the share of each airline for this total flow: 
					sqrt(airline_degree_a / airline_degree_b) / sum of share
			- Iteration: 
				- For each airport, add flows of all routes of the airport. 
				- increase / decrease the airport's flows - proportional to their share

- Content of the paper
	- Airlines comparison
		- Simple metrics
		- Distributions

	- Largeness ( length-2 paths weighted by geometric mean of patronages of connected airports. ) 
		- Research paper
		- Question: which potential connection would lead to the biggest largeness increase for an airline
		- Question: what potential does a merger of airlines/alliances bring
		- Alliances Game: calculate the alliance opportunity: largeness(N1 u N2) / Sum(largenesses) 

	- Comparing our model to a real world incident: Vanilla Alliance

- Ideas that we have: 
	- Looking at stock prices
	- Include data about profits
	- Comparing regions

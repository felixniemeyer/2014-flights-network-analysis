\begin{abstract}
	In this case study we are looking at a dataset about air travel in 2014. We implement some mechanisms to clean the data, as well as mechanisms to enrich this dataset with information we query from wikidata. We estimate some missing data. Starting from there, we analyze some network characteristics for the whole network as well as airline-specific sub-networks. We compare airline-specific networks and find relations between their network's characteristics and their business model. We propose one metric that plays a role in forcasting whether a cooperation between two airlines is advantageous and use this metric to generate an alliances landscape. We compare it's predictive correctness to the real world by looking at the formation of Vanilla Airlines which occured in the year after the one our data stems from.

\section{Data Description}

Cleaning <look at the cleaning script, shortly list what we do>

\section{Data Enrichment \& Estimation}
After cleaning up the data, there are 3139 airports. 

<degree distribution: even vs. odd degree occurences>

Besides the main subgraph, that includes 3113 nodes, there are 6 small disconnected ones with only a couple of nodes.
One with 10 nodes for example, consists only of airports that are located in New Caledonia, an archipelago in the Pacific Ocean.

In order to enable us to do more meaningful analysis, we enrich the dataset with additional information. We chose the airport patronage and found out, that we can get this data from Wikidata. 
For 1956 of the 3139 airports from the dataset, we can find patronage data from Wikidata. 
<describe how we do it: yearly vs. monthly + scaling from other years>
In order to populate the remaining nodes with reasonable patronages as well, we tried different techniques. 
First <using available data: runways -> factor -> calc. patronage per square feet + threshold, bad data quality. Show flow estimation iteration.>
Seccond <inspired by professor: algorithm that looks at neighboring airports patronage. Describe Algorithm. Show flow estimation iteration>

After estimating missing patronage data by looking at neighboring airports patronages, 14 airports without patronage remain. These must be in airports in disconnected subgraphs, because the algorithm would eventually reach them and assign a patronage otherwise. Investigations confirm that. We disregard these few dataless airports from disconnected subgraphs in the following analysises and thus end up with a network of 3125 airports.

\section{Airline Cooperation Opportunity}

The possibility to provide convenient on-line connections to clients is an important factor that drives welfare gains through ailine cooperation according to E. E. Bailey and D. Liu \cite{airline_consolidation_and_consumer_welfare}.

 abstract = {This paper provides a methodology to analyze the potential benefits and costs of airline mergers. The methodology is applied to the recent merger between North Central Airlines and Southern Airways. Our analysis of benefits focuses on product improvement-the superior product created by a merger which increases the amount of single-carrier versus multiple-carrier service. A conditional logit model of travel demand is used to estimate the benefit of the introduction of a superior product. Our analysis of possible costs (in reduced competition) focuses on the definition of the market and the significance of potential competition.},
